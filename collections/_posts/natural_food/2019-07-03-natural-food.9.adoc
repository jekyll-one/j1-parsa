Examples of natural foods include fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains,
nuts and seeds, lean meats, and fish. These foods are often found in their
natural state and are not heavily processed or refined. Depending on the
farming practices used, they may also be produced without pesticides
hormones, or antibiotics.

In summary, natural food is minimally processed and contains no artificial
ingredients or additives. It is often considered healthier and more nutritious
than processed food and may offer a range of health benefits when consumed
as part of a balanced diet.

improved digestion, increased nutrient intake, and reduced risk of chronic
diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Natural foods are
often more sustainable and environmentally friendly than heavily processed
or packaged foods.
